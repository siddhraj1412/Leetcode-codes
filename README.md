# LeetCode Codes 

This repository is a **personal collection of LeetCode solutions** that I’ve solved over time.

It exists purely as a **self-reference archive** — something I can revisit during final revision moments, interviews, or whenever I want to reflect on my problem-solving journey.

## Important
- This repository is **not intended for public use**
- No setup, installation, or execution instructions are provided
- Files are meant to be viewed or downloaded directly if needed

## What This Repo Represents
- Consistency in solving DSA problems
- Growth in logical thinking and coding approaches
- A personal log of solved LeetCode challenges across multiple topics

This is **not a tutorial repo** — it’s a snapshot of my learning curve.
